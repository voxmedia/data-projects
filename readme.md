# Data projects at Vox Media


## What makes for a good data project? 

Good data projects are an extension of the reporting process that rely on quantitative information to inform and educate. They should help flesh out a story and reveal information by means of analysis that would not otherwise be apparent.


## Guidelines

- Include guidelines for the processing of data, or at the very least document changes that have been made to the source and include it alongside the output.

- Context should always accompany data and aid in the understanding of a dataset.

- Add information about how to contribute to the project. Also include contribution information for one-off projects that likely will not be updated. Example:

```
This project is shared as-is. Bugs, issues, and pull requests may 
not be readily addressed.
```

- List the authors and/or contact information.

### Copyright and licensing

- Provide origin of dataset.

- Make sure we have permission to include the dataset in the repo. 

- Be clear on what exactly we are claiming as copyright, if relevant. For example, if we're using public domain government data, then what we claim as copyright is any script that transforms the dataset into something usable for a project. The data itself is still publicly domain. 

- This is the open source license that goes out with other Vox Media projects:
